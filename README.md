<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Protectors Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://faberwerks.itch.io/protectors)

<p align="justify">
    <strong>Protectors</strong> (creatively codenamed <em>Project thisGame</em>) is a 2D endless arcade strategy game for Windows. You play as Mother Nature and must plant and protect the trees in your forest. Humans will try to cut them down. Each tree has a seed cost and has a different role to play. You will lose. The question is: how long will you survive? The game is available for free on itch.io <a href="https://faberwerks.itch.io/protectors">here</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Protectors was not the first game that Faberwerks began developing (that would be <a href="https://faberwerks.itch.io/valanthion">Valanthion</a>). However, it was the first game that we released. Protectors was originally our entry to the 2018 Melon Game Jam. After it ended, we decided to remake it (this time, of course, with much more time) using the exact same concept with improved graphics (we had no artist at the game jam) and better balancing.

    Although this repository is primarily for former members of Faberwerks (which has since disbanded) to use so they can come back to study, use this as reference, or just reminisce, anyone who comes across this project is welcome to see the project. However, you may not use any part of this repository for your own purposes without first confirming with us.
